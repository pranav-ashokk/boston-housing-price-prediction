# Boston Housing Price Prediction
This project (among a couple others) is considered the 'Hello World' of machine learning. Throughout this project, I learned how to follow a standard machine learning project workflow for a supervised regression problem. However, this workflow is applicable to any type of machine learning problem.

## Workflow
1) Defining the problem
2)                                                                                                    

The model is given various data (features) from houses that were sold in a specific Boston neighborhood. From this data, the model can then predict the selling price of a new house in the neighborhood before it is sold based on the various features it has. In this situation, the target feature is therefore the selling price of a house in a Boston neighborhood.
